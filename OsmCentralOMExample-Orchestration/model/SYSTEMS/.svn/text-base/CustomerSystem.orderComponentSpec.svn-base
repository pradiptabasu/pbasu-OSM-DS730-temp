  <com:displayName>Customer System</com:displayName>
  <com:information>The customer system is responsible for managing customer orders as well as all customer interactions. The customer system sends customer orders into central fulfillment, and needs to be notified of any updates to the order including milestones reached and overall status of the order. In this sample cartridge, the customer system is notified of the order items' status after they have been billed for. &#xD;
&#xD;
This order component specification for a customer system is used in the decomposition stage that determines the target fulfillment system. Order items are targeted to this customer system based on the SyncCustomerToCustomerSystem decomposition rule. In this sample cartridge, there is a single customer system. All order items that require a SyncCustomer function are targeted to this customer system.</com:information>
